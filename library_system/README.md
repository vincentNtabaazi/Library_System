Library system

The library system is an web application that houses an electronic library system.
The system was developed to avail students access to a variety of educational books with as much ease as possible.

source: http://library_9/?  , http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Running: The web application can is supported by all web browsers.


Operation:

step 1: Registering and log-in

On loading the web application, the user sees a brief detail of the library catalog and to access it, 
the user must register. The register button once clicked takes the user to a form where they enter 
their username, email-address, registration number and desired password. This takes the user to 
the log-in page where they enter their username and password.

step 2: Searching for a book
Once logged in, the user is able to see a short preview of some of the books in the library. If the
desired book is not among them then the user can do a search based on the title or genre of the 
book using the search bar. If the book is unavailable, a message appears showing the book has been 
borrowed. If the book is available, the user proceeds to select and borrow the book.

step 3: Borrowing the book
After the desired book is selected, the user is able to see a short description of the book and the 
borrow button. Once the borrow button is clicked, it redirects the user to the homepage page which 
shows a message saying “The book is ready to be picked.” and the set return date. In case the user 
wants to keep track of the return date, the user can easily check through the profile button which 
directs them to a page showing the books they have borrowed and the date they should be returned 
and fines if any.
